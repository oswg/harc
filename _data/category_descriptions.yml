# Circles
"Circles/Colorado Springs Circle": "The founding members of the Other Selves Working Group formed this circle in the throes of the pandemic in 2020 to begin building a body of channeled information from the Confederation. In 2021 they met for their first channeling intensive in Colorado Springs, Colorado, making contact with Laitos, the Confederation's designated social memory complex for training instruments. The circle quickly graduated to contact with Q'uo, and they met at two later intensives in 2022. With the departure of Dartez and Norby from the Working Group, the circle disbanded. Tyman and Weiland formed a new circle shortly after to carry on the project."
"Circles/Richmond Meditation Circle": |
  Jeremy Weiland founded the Richmond Meditation Circle in November 2018. For over five years the circle has welcomed seekers from a variety of spiritual backgrounds to share in a simple meditation and discussion. We meet on Mondays at 7:00 PM EST at First Unitarian Universalist Church of Richmond. Please email Jeremy at jeremy at otherselvesworking dot group if you plan to attend for the first time. All who are open minded and respectful are welcome to attend, and while we are open to all positive beliefs, we tend in the direction of the Law of One philosophy as a centering premise for our discussions.

  The circle also maintains a site of channelled contact with the Confederation of Planets in Service to the One Infinite Creator. By gradually building a space through our weekly meditations where it is safe to share from the heart, the circle has cultivated a setting that allows Jeremy to practice as an instrument with this circle. For now, the circle sticks to more comfortable fourth and fifth density contacts, drawing its inquiries from the material of their lives and seeking. Other Selves Working Group members are occasionally extended invitations to attend over video conference to share in the energy, intention-setting, and question crafting or topic choosing.

  While our regular meditations are public and open to all, our channelling sessions are private collective workings of intimacy and trust. We ask that seekers interested in our channelling sessions be familiar with Confederation philosophy. Also, prospective participants should have already attended enough regular meditations with us so that their energy and seeking can be properly integrated into our project. Contact Jeremy for more information.
"Circles/The High Altitude Receiving Center (HARC) Circle": "Following the dissolution of the Colorado Springs circle, Steve and Jeremy invited two Other Selves Working Group members to begin training to channel in late 2022. One member resigned from the group, but the other continued and joined Weiland and Tyman at the fourth channeling intensive in Breckenridge, Colorado in June 2023. This circle is attempting to coordinate all seekers in the Confederation tradition towards a single intention: a disciplined calling for information and inspiration from the Confederation of Planets in Service to the One Infinite Creator. The goal is to think of the HARC circle as drawing upon a collective, concentrated calling to which we all contribute. This will also provide the basis for future instruments to receive training and to potentially spread this model of group seeking."

"Events/Fifth Channeling Intensive": "Held November 3-8, 2023 in Estes Park, Colorado, the Fifth Channeling Intensive was the first to have a theme. Focusing on a variety of aspects to will, the HARC circle eventually integrated concepts related to will such as magical practice, desire, and memory in its primitive and cosmic forms."
"Events/Sixth Channeling Intensive": "The Sixth Channeling Intensive was held from October 31 - November 5, 2024 in Estes Park, Colorado. While the theme centered on exploring archetypal mind topics, it was also the setting for training up three new instruments for Q'uo. Certain sessions that are training-heavy and lacking in much content relevant to the Law of One seeker will not be published; other training sessions that have more to offer may be published in a special \"training\" section of HARC."
"Events/Gathering '24": "The Other Selves Working Group is an online group of seekers, many who have never met in person. The Gathering '24 from June 6 - 10, 2024 was an opportunity to share company, have important discussions, and train up new instruments who were interested. Because of the latter task, many of the sessions were not recorded, but three have been made available."
