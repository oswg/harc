This is a sample post. In Jekyll you set custom fields in the front matter:

- **circle** – circle name
- **event** – event name  
- **session** – session number
- **date** – session date (also used for post date)
- **categories** – e.g. `Transcripts` or `Training Session` (training sessions show the caveat and label)

Content below the front matter is rendered as the post body.
