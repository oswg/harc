title: Laitos on Sovereignty
Event: sixth-channeling-intensive
Session: '005'
Group Questions: What is the role of sovereignty in polarization towards service to others?
Introduction: In this training session for newer instruments, the entity Laitos explores the concept of both individual and collective sovereignty as it relates to the spiritual journey and the evolution of consciousness. Laitos discusses how sovereignty is a recognition of one's power and the ability to respect others' personal domains, which is especially relevant in the face of the challenges posed by Earth's economic and political systems, emphasizing the role of the heart in connecting individuals and understanding the blend of personal and collective sovereignty. They suggest sovereignty is not a solitary endeavor but a collective one, where shared experiences and empathy can strengthen both individual and communal sovereignty. The concept of dignity is highlighted as a key aspect of sovereignty, suggesting that recognizing dignity in others can transform sovereignty from a defensive stance to a basis for unity.

## Channeled message

_(Jeremy channeling)_

**I am Laitos**. Greetings in the love and light of our radiant one, the Infinite Creator. Salutations and thanks we offer you for the starting phases of a discipline that we are confident will augment your seeking and serve our Creator.&nbsp;

It is our pleasure to be with you, for we are ourselves experiencing in this circle new aspects of the relationship between your world and ours. And in doing so, we are exposed to little side lessons that help us on our path of seeking towards a more wisdom-oriented curriculum. And it is exercising this upward-spiraling light in our own lives, in our own seeking, that we in such a spirit reach back to you as fellow travelers, not so distant from us as you may suppose from your veiled position, in this wondrous and glowing, vibrating creation.&nbsp;

As always, please take our words with a grain of salt, and should they have a flavor that is displeasing in any way, know that you must not consume them just then. Perhaps they will find a place in your heart or challenge your mind with profit at some later point. Perhaps not; perhaps we have overextended our help and have reached in a way that is upsetting or simply not feeling right at the moment. My brothers and sisters, one of the most important things you are learning is discernment: discernment without any standard but one's own heart. Please learn this lesson as diligently as you can, so that we may adjust and ourselves learn and better serve our Creator. Thank you for your discretion and your careful assessment of what we have to share.&nbsp;

The subject is an interesting one for our complex, for in our third density experience we did not so much struggle with this concept of metering out what is ours and what is not ours through this concept of sovereignty. This was not so much our experience. Instead, we learned more about the lessons of keeping a self integrated in spite of a great deal of dependence and sharing.&nbsp;

In your experience, however, there are great yellow ray forces at work. Beyond this, you have the intervention in this unique Logoic experiment of your system, and this experiment is as apt to frustrate as it is to elucidate what is the Creator's nature. We and others in the Confederation have learned new degrees of acceptance, new ways in which sorrow can pierce us to the core. And we are willing students of your able lessons, which your lives offer us and your hearts demand that we provide our spiritual solidarity.&nbsp;

To begin, sovereignty is a kind of recognition of one's capacity for power. In this recognition, one can identify it in others, and in a healthy setting, the recognition and respect of others' domain of personal sovereignty is part and parcel of the expectation one may have of one's own. And indeed, many of you carry the memory of this balanced relating into this illusion, into your experience on this sphere. And it does not surprise us one bit that you would feel stymied by the constant invasions and bids for dispossession that your economic and political systems evince so starkly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

This is intensified when the density barrier is crossed, and those friends of ours who complement our path on the negative register can truly energize what is already the zeitgeist here: the accrued feelings of constraint, where freedom is only won through the bellicosity, the superior willingness to burn it all down. We feel your yearning for peace, and we understand how, even though this illusion tends to bend that search for peace within, nevertheless, one must find a way to express it without, in a way that is authentic and honest, not simply going through the motions of a religious or ethical teaching.&nbsp;

To elaborate on the qualities that sovereignty consists of, and how they relate to seeking with trueness to one's deep self, we would release contact from this instrument at this time, moving the beam over to the instrument known as Linus. We are those of Laitos.

_(Linus channeling)_

**We are those of Laitos** , and we are now with this instrument. We will now continue our exploration of the qualities of sovereignty, and how they relate to the inner relationship one has to self.&nbsp;

Sovereignty is that which one perceives as the field of one's creation, the domain of influence of the self. And though in your experience this concept of sovereignty is most usually applied to the outer world, inwardly the self is a very appropriate locus of consideration of this concept. Within oneself there are emotions, there are desires, there are visions, experiences, dreams, thoughts; and it is natural for one to wish to influence the unfolding of these things. Now as one seeks to learn one's particular path of polarization, then this is a choice that is being made, and we ask for your consideration to consider these questions in reflection, if you will: What is my relationship to myself and how I choose to view myself? What is that that I wish to create in myself? How do I wish to experience myself? And what is it that I choose to learn from myself?&nbsp;

These questions, though perhaps not reflected upon consciously, are themes central to knowing the self. When sovereignty is brought to bear in consideration of this, one may consider: what power do I have to influence the process in accordance with choice? And in this, we would suggest that it is well to seek the support of others that are choosing similarly to combine intention and seeking, and to collectively invite light and support from the One Infinite Creator in learning how to proceed in one's chosen path of learning.&nbsp;

In sovereignty, one chooses the domain in which creative power is directed, and collectively this may become a shared domain in which shared sovereignty must be exercised to create. And so, as each individual pursues authorship in self, this may transition, in practice, to a shared exploration of sovereignty.&nbsp;

We are Laitos, and at this time we will transfer the contact to the one known as Baris. We are Laitos.&nbsp;

_(Baris channeling)_

**We are Laitos** , and we continue. The collective consciousness and the sovereignty of the collective is a topic that we'd like to explore further with you.&nbsp;

As you transition into fourth density consciousness, you are working with the light available in your hearts to open yourself up, to connect, and to create. Sovereignty, in this instance, is both of your individual self as well as the collective self.&nbsp;

Sovereignty of the collective comes from the heart of your being. Throughout the day your being—your field of consciousness—interacts with other fields of consciousness around you, and as you work to open the heart, to connect with your hearts, you are working both on understanding who you truly are and, collectively, how you belong as one unity of consciousness. This act of opening the heart, this act of pouring out the love in your heart onto your day-to-day, is the act that you work on as the energy moves from your power, from your third chakra, to the heart. And in that instance, as you hold each other dearly, as you hold each other in your hearts, you are learning the boundaries of sovereignty of the self as well as of the collective.&nbsp;

Your personal truth, your sovereignty, is meshing, is blending; it's not a solid boundary. So, as you work with it, my friends, you will find it skillful to come back into your hearts. Heart is the jumping point, that energy that flows out and connects: connects unconditionally and lifts each other up.&nbsp;

We are Laitos, and with this, we will transfer this contact to the one known as Jamie.&nbsp;

(_Jamie channeling)_

**We are Laitos**. We are now with this instrument and will continue our thoughts on this concept of sovereignty.&nbsp;

This concept of sovereignty is your birthright. Yet in this so dense illusion, there are so many apparent challenges, confrontations, and conflicts with the so-called terms and conditions of third density existence. It is nearly incomprehensible, the ways that our sovereignty is buffeted.

It is a distraction—an effective one—that often leads to the idea that our sovereignty is ours alone to defend, to bolster. Yet, this, my friends, is illusory. Is not your sovereignty a collective effort? A shared effort? An everyday way to affirm our unity in the sharing of our common struggles in this density?&nbsp;

This instrument enjoys an apparent confidence in sovereignty and perceives mostly societal challenges to sovereignty as the concern, yet desires to comfort others, understand others, and share. Through community, through connection, through sharing experiences and empathy, may our own sovereignties and collective sovereignties be bolstered. It's ironic that we must be vulnerable in sharing our fears, that we then open the pathway to shared understanding where there is automatic lightening of these perceived threats. We encourage you to call, to reach out and to share through your connection, honesty, and courage, so that your own armors may be strengthened.&nbsp;

We thank you, each of you, for joining in today's discussion of this topic that seems so foreign to us, yet for you, as this instrument would say, all up in your face. We view your circle and are humbled by its purity and light. At this time, we will pass this contact to the one known as Jeremy. We are Laitos.

_(Jeremy channeling)_

**We are Laitos** and find ourselves again with this instrument, and we will be brief in our concluding remarks in two wises.

First, we wish you to understand that part of the charge involved in sovereignty—both metaphysically and materially in your yellow-ray illusion—revolves around the aspect of the Creator's majesty in microcosm, which you might label, “dignity.” My friends, if you can find dignity in each other, then sovereignty can begin to melt away as a defensive and protective concept and instead be a basis for continued merging, prefiguring that which is to come in later densities, and this is good practice for the third density seeker. Indeed, exploring our own concept of dignity, in spite of our boundaries, continues to enliven our seeking and challenge our models of reality such that we may expand into the next density, and we feel its call very strongly.&nbsp;

Finally, we wish to express our deep and unconditional respect for your individual sovereignty as an instrument. And we hope that in this contact our conditioning has been modulated and attenuated such that you have not been made to feel uncomfortable.[1](#footnote-1) Should this arise, it is very simple, my friends, to simply request of our complex a change, a desire to lighten up. For you must understand our enthusiasm for your project, and like anybody who loves, we sometimes get carried away.&nbsp;

We will now allow ourselves to be carried away in that illusory manner in which we part ways with you in this setting, but never in the domain of spirit where we draw all of our dignity, all of our sovereignty, and learn to find the completeness of our love.&nbsp;We bid you adieu, my brothers and sisters, as your friends of planet Laitos. Adonai vasu borragus.&nbsp;☥

In previous training sessions, new instruments reported intense or unpleasant sensations that sound like classic conditioning, or the transmission from the contact to the instrument of subjectively significant experiences intended to confirm the reality of the contact.
