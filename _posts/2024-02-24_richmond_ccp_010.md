title: Monka on Discovering a New Center
group_question: How can we relate to our past and its fixed, unchangeable nature in a manner that allows us to take the measure of our lessons and apply them to what lies before us?
introduction: Monka provides thoughts on effectively relating to one's past experience as the seeker perceives a new stage of life ahead, thereby implicitly closing out an old stage and in some sense an old self. Though it may seem like a sacrifice to let go of those parts of the self that represent the old, known configuration, it is really just about putting these parts in a different configuration by rewriting the narrative. Throughout the session Monka uses the visual of "concentric circles" as a way to think about the structure that consciousness assumes as it discovers new centers of attraction at various scales. These include the mind/body/spirit complex, the meditation circle and its rippling effects outward, the mirroring effect, and the relationship between higher density complexes and third density humans. They lastly provide some insight into how the circle members may cultivate better contact.
