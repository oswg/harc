title: Q'uo on Cynicism
event: ci4
session: '008'
group_question: The question for this session is how does one best relate to the cynicism within oneself?
introduction: Those of Q'uo address the dynamic of cynicism or doubt as a normal aspect of life in third density given how little we truly know and can see about the nature of our illusion. Working with this cynicism is part and parcel of working with its opposite, faith, and in this balancing we learn to ascertain the true nature of reality through direct experience. Q'uo also discusses the role cynicism plays in how we relate to other selves as a projection of our inner integration.

(_Nithin Channeling_)

**We are Q’uo**. We are with this instrument. We greet you in the love and light of the One Infinite Creator. We are very happy to be with you here today and amongst this circle, and are thankful to have the opportunity to join our energies with yours and to answer your queries.&nbsp;

You have asked us to speak on the nature of cynicism within oneself and how best to relate to it. We would also first caution the listeners and say that we give our perspective on this subject, but please use your own discernment and judgment in finding value and what we have to say.&nbsp;

Let us first start by suggesting that cynicism or doubt is or can be of different natures. There is cynicism within the mind, but there is also a possible cynicism or doubt within the spirit complex, and indeed even in certain situations where there is a catalyst involving cynicism or doubt, it may even manifest in the body. However, cynicism or doubt is a natural part of life in third density, as full knowing is not possible on this plane. And so what is important is exactly what the questioner has grasped, how best to relate to this concept within ourselves and to its presence as it occurs.

Cynicism is an important aspect of polarization in third density, for it both helps ground and discern one's sometimes seemingly subjective experiences that are often open to a multitude of interpretations. And while one should not necessarily wholly, or should we say fully, embrace the sole perspective of any cynicism or doubt, it is important to be open to cynicism or doubt, because it is only through that openness that it can truly diminish.

It is useful to explore what is often the opposite concept of cynicism, and that is faith. As with any set of opposite concepts, one cannot exist without the other. If one does not truly entertain cynicism, then one cannot truly experience faith, and it is by the contact, shall we say, with the turbulent emotion of of cynicism or doubt, while also studying its opposite in the various comings and goings&nbsp;of third density life, that one can begin to appreciate the interplay between these two concepts, for powerful it is indeed to have a great cynicism or doubt&nbsp;of a given experience be transformed into one of great faith. This transformation of cynicism into faith can be aided by the mind, but ultimately this transformation comes about as one begins to experience the true nature of reality by experiencing the momentum that the path of polarity has in third density.

When one wrestles with cynicism and finds faith, naturally and organically over the course of many different catalytic events, a strange thing occurs where the seeker begins to directly experience at the spirit complex level -- but also at the at the mind complex level -- the underlying nature of unveiled reality. And although this may not initially be consciously understood as such a direct experience, upon accumulation of these direct experiences, cynicism and doubt begins to naturally fall away, because when one directly experiences something, the question of whether one believes it to be true or not becomes less relevant.

Consider for example the question of whether you are truly alive. While this question can be entertained with cynicism and doubt within the mind, because we experience this to be true in a very direct way, the question of cynicism and doubt naturally falls away. So too in the seeker's journey, as one builds momentum on their chosen path of polarity, the openness to both cynicism and faith transforms strongly&nbsp;into one of direct experience. And so the question becomes less relevant, but it is important to keep in mind that this is a natural falling away, and desiring or attempting to speed up the process can sometimes actually extend it.

It is in a certain sense the formation and the strengthening of the relationship between the smaller self and the greater self, for it is truly only the smaller self that doubts, and cynicism plays an important role in discernment, for a third density is filled with seemingly random influxes of energy. And so it would be wise to always give space to cynicism while being open to the potential that there is indeed more at play.

We are Q'uo, and we now take leave of this instrument.

**Steve** : Q'uo, may I interrupt just long enough to ask a question?

**Q'uo** : Yes.

**Steve** : I wonder if you would speak to the way criticism relates to an attempt to build trust with regard to other selves, particularly if we're on the path of service-to-others.

**We are Q'uo**. We are with this instrument. We hear your query, brother.

Cynicism as it pertains&nbsp;to other selves is in part a natural perspective as a part of the many perspectives within oneself about the other selves. We would suggest, however, that while one can hold feelings of cynicism towards the other self, particularly with respect to trust of the other self, it is important to be open to the possibility of having faith in the other self, of trusting the other self. Whether this other self is&nbsp;a newly acquainted other self or whether this other self is one who you have interacted with many times in the past with experiences that suggest that they cannot be trusted.

That is not to say that naiveté is an appropriate attitude, especially with respect to other selves that have done things that have not been trustworthy. But by leaving open the possibility, however seemingly slim,&nbsp;that such an other self may change in the future is important because it indeed reflects the nature of one's own cynicism and lack of trust&nbsp;of parts of the self, of things within you.

Have we sufficiently answered your question, my brother?

**Steve** : Yes, thank you, Q'uo.

**Q'uo:** Are there any other questions at this time?

_(No response)_

**We are Q'uo** , we thank this circle for the opportunity to answer these questions, and we now take leave of this instrument.&nbsp;Adonai, Adonai, Adonai.
