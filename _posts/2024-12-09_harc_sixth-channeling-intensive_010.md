title: Q'uo on Faith
event: ci6
session: '010'
introduction: Q'uo discusses faith as an essential element in the third-density journey of learning love, where individuals navigate an illusion of separateness and fear. Faith is compared to the archetype of the Fool, who fearlessly steps forward, trusting that all is well. This journey of faith involves questioning identity and purpose, making choices of service to others or self, and working through the chakras, starting from the base and moving towards the heart center where the realization of universal love and connectedness begins. As individuals progress, faith grows, guiding them through life's uncertainties and leading to spiritual evolution. Q'uo emphasizes that faith is not just belief but a faculty that develops with an open heart, and it is through faith that one can continually connect to the unconditional love of the One Infinite Creator.

**We are Q'uo** , and we are with this instrument. We are delighted to join your gathering this morning and to talk about faith, core essential topic in your third density illusion as you learn the lessons of love.&nbsp;

Before we start, we'd like to remind you again that we are not infallible. We are brothers and sisters along the same path, and as such, we ask for your discrimination as you hear these words. Please take what resonates with you and leave the rest behind, as we wish not to be a stumbling block on your path.&nbsp;We’d like to start this topic of exploration by stepping back and taking a look at the illusion.

The illusion that you occupy in this space and time is made of the love of the One Infinite Creator. However, as the individuated portion of the love, you experience the illusion of separateness—that you are not connected to the Source that is all, but instead as beings in bodies that are clearly separated from one another.&nbsp;In this illusory context, there is an element of fear that arises from your desire of survival. As you're separated, should you survive?

With this, my friends, the journey begins. As you go throughout your days and throughout lifetimes, you collect experience, and with this experience you learn. You experience many facets of love and the perceived lack of love. You experience fear, you experience anger, frustration, and you collect these experiences that become part of your being.&nbsp;

As you accumulate these experiences, as you gain the experience, you start wondering, start trying to understand who you are, what your purpose is. And with that attempt to understand, the first step is taken.&nbsp;

Those of Ra have given the practice, the phrase, "where is the love in the moment?" As you ask yourselves, "who am I;" as you look at situations and the experience and start asking, "where is the love in this moment," you take your staff with your feet firmly on the path, you start taking your steps. It's a magnificent journey; a magnificent journey on which you're not alone. You're ever and always supported by those beings incarnate and discarnate who are there for you along your journey.&nbsp;

So my friends, the question, "where is the love in the moment?" That journey that starts centers around the very central decision that you're supposed to make in your third density illusion. It is the choice, the choice of service, either to serve others, to radiate the love, or to bend that love to your needs, to have others serve you in the service-to-self.&nbsp;

So as faith goes, faith—a core part of that twenty-second archetype—the choice, the fool that takes his staff, and the fool that walks, walks and walks knowing that each step taken is right and all is well. Each step taken, without even taking a look, one step after the other, the journey starts.&nbsp;

As you get closer and closer to the adepthood, as you work on the lower chakras of your energy system, starting with the red, knowing that you're safe and you're accepted. Moving on to the orange ray of the relationship, most importantly, the self with the self and the self with one another, healing these relationships, making them whole, viewing them from a higher vantage point, you move on to the third chakra, your powerhouse where much of the work in the third density illusion is done. It's your relationship with groups, be it the family, the society, the work where the relationship of power and the balance of power are explored.

Once identity in relationship to these groups—the balance, the domination or being dominated—are explored, and once that is in balance, once the lower chakras are in balance, which takes a lifetime, more than a lifetime, you move to your heart center, the center of universal love and connectedness, recognizing your eternal being, your eternal connection with one another and with all that there is, and the great work begins. It is from the heart center that you start your great work, and the element of faith continues to develop, knowing that all is well; knowing that as you serve one another, you serve the Infinite Ccreator to know itself; knowing that you're all connected; that as you move the energy up to your blue ray, the fifth chakra, as you open that chakra, it's your will to communicate your personal truth.

You work up to the indigo ray, to continue the work in consciousness.&nbsp;It's faith, the resting into the knowing that all is well. It's not a belief; it's a faculty that develops as the heart opens, as the devotion builds, and the great work continues.&nbsp;

We are those of Q'uo, and at this time, we'd like to continue this conversation by passing the baton to the one known as Linus.&nbsp;

**We are Q'uo** , and we are with this instrument at this time.&nbsp;We would like to continue our discussion on the theme of faith by returning to the image, the archetype, the persona of the fool, the choice, who appears as a traveler, an adventurer.

Each of us are set out on a great adventure into unknown territory. Each of us have received reports of the terrain ahead from others that have traveled. But to one that is on the journey, one is where one is, and there is both mystery, excitement, but also challenges on this journey.

As one walks the road, and sometimes needing to depart from the road, or the road becomes less clear, one can experience many different emotions or feelings about what one is encountering in a moment, given a challenge or situation. In these situations where it appears to be unclear what choice to make, one must rely on learnings, biases, intuition, and hope that stem from things not apparent, but felt. There is a sense, at times, that there is no path forward, but we ask you to keep a keen eye to look out of the corner of your eye with attention for that hidden line that lies beneath the surface, the critical path forward that is hidden and otherwise not seen.

And this is the exercise of faith: to gradually build this relationship with the love that holds you in each moment you find yourself, that grace and providence that leads you forward through your lessons. Each opportunity to exercise faith leads one deeper into the mystery, and mystery leads you deeper into faith. If one can appreciate the beauty of the moment, this can be a line that can be traced to the love that gave rise to its creation and its intention, and can be a resource for strengthening the faith.&nbsp;

We are those of Q'uo, and at this time we would transfer the contact to the one known as Jamie.&nbsp;

**We are Q'uo** , and we are with this instrument, and we will continue to share our thoughts on the subject of faith. For, my brothers and sisters, you are truly fumbling through the dark with very little assurances and validations of your true infinite nature. Even with this instrument, who is attempting to convey our thoughts, is doing so solely on faith, trying to gently set aside the urges to rehearse, to prepare, and to be correct.

This is a small microcosm of what you do every day on this planet. It is so easy to reach for comforts, make a plan, make a list, and feel confident that you know what will come. And how often are these well-laid plans turned upside down when you reach them? We encourage you to remember that all is well. Every moment presents a new opportunity to exercise this faith.

Where would you be? How would you progress if everything was certain? In a state of entropy, with little progress on the path. Of all the mysterious and complicated archetypical modes for progress, the crowning archetype of them all is the path of the fool. As our fellow instruments have shared our thoughts, we again return to the fool who, with nothing but the clothes on his back, moves forward to meet the next opportunity for choice.

With each choice, the next choice is doubled. The fool has no time for self-deprecation or worry. He just keeps going.

We are very grateful to have this opportunity to communicate with you on this beautiful day, and we wish to remind you that within you always is connection to the source of love unconditional. We are those of Q'uo. Adonai. ☥
