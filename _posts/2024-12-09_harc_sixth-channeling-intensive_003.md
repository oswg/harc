title: Laitos on Forgiveness
Event: ci6
Session: '003'
Introduction: In this short training sessions, Laitos addresses the intensity of negative emotions that can be worked with through the energy of forgiveness. These emotions are often brought into our awareness through events involving others, but there is always a component of self that requires forgiving as well. Laitos considers forgiveness of the self an important part of self-acceptance, recognizing its capacity to heal many different states of confused and uncomfortable feeling.

**We are those of Laitos**. We greet you, my brothers and sisters, in the love, light, and care of our One Infinite Creator and offer our sincere thanks for your efforts today. We are pleased to work with each one of you and ask that you not be alarmed at any conditioning which we may be offering, for the experience of the instrument is not one that can be simply explained and charted out by your fellow practitioners.&nbsp;

In this light, we ask for your careful and patient review of concepts we offer, and if any should give you pause or strike you as not for you—and there are many reasons a given idea would not suit you—we would ask that you apply your most rigorous assessment of suitability to it and leave it behind on your journey should it not match your purposes. For we see in your hearts, my friends, a purpose that perhaps has not yet dawned upon you, that swells from deep inside, and it must be given time to sprout, blossom, and yield its fruit. Thank you for exercising your discernment in what we offer, for this frees us to speak and share, to compare notes with comrades in spirit.

Our topic today revolves around the subject of forgiveness, and we would speak to this as we have spoken several times in the past with this circle and others. We offer the idea on forgiveness that it is an expression of one's true commitment to staying with the heartbeat of creation even in those cases when one has felt damage. When this damage occurs as a result of conditions that seem to have no interpersonal or moral or ethical valence, it is much easier to pass them by without charging them with a sense of disappointment or resentment or, as this instrument often experiences, outrage.&nbsp;

The shock that can come from seeing a reflection that calls to a smaller concept of yourself than you care to consider can truly arrest your forward momentum, for you use mirrors in just this way: am I correctly oriented upon the path? Are there dangers or conditions of note which I should consider? Are my brothers and sisters truly and deeply my brothers and sisters in reality? Or have I conjured these heartfelt relationships out of thin air and am now tasting a kind of consequence of my foolishness in extending trust and friendship?&nbsp;

My friends, this is an expression of the kind of emotional experience that catalysis will incur in your life, and we would like to explore this with your help. Therefore, having laid out a basis for this exploration, we release this instrument from contact, moving it to the instrument known as Jamie. We are those of Laitos.

_(Jamie channeling)_

**We are Laitos** , and we are with this instrument.&nbsp;

This instrument feels drawn to recent experiences, where she was caught up in the feelings of anger and surprising distrust of others she thought she understood. This resulted in one member of the group being excluded, and this instrument feels that they contributed to this harm done to another.

Often, the potency of emotions and feelings sweep us away and blind us to the damage it may cause others, and upon reflection only then may we begin to open our perception and have empathy. Forgiveness is not a terminus; it is something we must cultivate and recognize. It's not always with another person.

Forgiveness also is intertwined with acceptance of the self. It is so difficult to look at the self as what needs forgiving, but that is the foundation and an opening and where we can begin to…&nbsp;

This instrument is having difficulty with focus, so at this time we will transfer the contact to the one known as Linus. We are Laitos.

_(Linus channeling)_

**We are Laitos** , and we are now with the one known as Linus, and we continue to share our thoughts on the topic of forgiveness.

In the course of daily interactions with other selves, relationships with loved ones or people with which one may work, [or] friends, one encounters situations that result in conflict, and this in turn gives rise to think, reflect, and consider justice and injustice, whether we feel that we have been treated unfairly or unjustly or vice versa. In some instances, perhaps in most instances, we may find it easier to extend forgiveness to the other. However, in other cases we may find that forgiveness of self is just as needed.&nbsp;

We ask the question for contemplation on how it is possible to learn and practice forgiveness of others when forgiveness of self is not practiced or applied. In the inner life of each individual there can arise many instances in which we are willing to extend forgiveness to others but not to the self. And so we like to explore aspects of this practice of extending forgiveness to the self.&nbsp;

Forgiveness is also a kind of release and carries with it an energy of renewal, a reframing, and so in this way the forgiveness of oneself can be seen as a way of transformation of how one relates to oneself. Much of our ideas that feel restrictive or related to shame or guilt can be transformed through forgiveness. Indeed also there may be things that one has not consciously considered which at deeper levels of mind have given rise to feelings of self-hatred or feelings of self-disgust. Often these feelings can show themselves as anger, and when difficult emotions regarding the self emerge, one may be well advised to consider where forgiveness may provide relief and acceptance of the self.

At this time we extend our gratitude and thankfulness for the invitation to join your circle and speak to you concerning this theme of forgiveness. Thank you for allowing us to blend our energies with you at this time. We leave you in the love and the light of our One Infinite Creator. ☥
