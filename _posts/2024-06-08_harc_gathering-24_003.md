title: Q'uo on Purifying Desire
group_question: Today, Q'uo, we would like to hear your thoughts on the purification of desire.
introduction: The Q’uo principle addresses the Other Selves Working Group at their 2024 gathering on the complicated subject of desire and how it is refined in the midst of spiritual seeking. As both a force shaping us and being shaped by our continually discovered biases, we learn to work with the great variety of desires, both in how they relate to each other and how they might be expressed and integrated. Because these desires tend to dip below consciousness, Q’uo reminds us of the veil’s purpose in stimulating polarization in third density, forming the basis for a kind of organization of desires that allow us to pursue our chosen pole. Even frustrated desire can be very instructive to a mind/body/spirit complex’s larger evolution, especially when it comes to reconciling our polarized choice with the constellation of desires the seeker continually discovers within its complex.
