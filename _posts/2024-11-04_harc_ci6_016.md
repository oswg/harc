title: Q'uo on the Experience of Spirit
introduction: Here Q'uo offers an exploration of the spiritual journey as one traverses the less-trodden paths of the spirit complex. The communication delves into the adept's experience of navigating the subtleties of spiritual evolution, particularly the activation of the indigo ray energy center and its disorienting effects. Q'uo discusses the thinning of the veil and the resulting heightened sensitivity to the energies that well up from within, which can dramatically alter the adept's perception of daily catalysts and interactions with others. The narrative addresses the challenges of maintaining service-to-others orientation amidst newfound powers of perception and influence, cautioning against the risks of control and repulsion that may arise. The adept is guided to confront internal distortions with hope, recognizing that the light of faith can illuminate the path to redemption, even when faced with seemingly insurmountable inner shadows. This message from Q'uo is a deep examination of the spiritual path's complexities, inviting the seeker to embrace the transformative power of faith and the continuous responsibility of self-awareness.

_(Steve channeling)_

**I am Q'uo** , and we greet you in the love and in the light of the One Infinite Creator. It is our great honor to be able to speak with you upon a subject which is not well known among your people, and to travel with you along paths little traveled. We ourselves still experience travel upon this path and have perhaps a little more history, shall we say, in doing so. And of that history we are most happy to draw upon, to bring forward for what edification you may glean from it.&nbsp;

But we do ask you to remember that, most especially in these regions, your uttermost discernment is required. For we would not give to you any hint or indication that might induce you to put a false foot upon the path. And we are not able to ascertain, from where we stand, just exactly what a false foot would mean for you.&nbsp;

Responsibility for the self grows immeasurably when one has entered the domain of spirit; and that is the domain that this day we have been asked to address.&nbsp;

The seeker who has passed through the long and often troubled pathways prior to entering the cavernous expanse of spirit through, we would say, the narrowest of apertures, will have some substantial experience in dealing with issues of polarity, issues of choice often featured as that between right and wrong, good and bad, positive and negative. These factors continue to be at play throughout the life experience. And the mere fact that one may have gotten to the point where it becomes possible to work in the element of spirit does not absolve the seeker from the considerations that have occupied much of the daily life experience up to that point.&nbsp;

However, when entering more directly the spirit complex, the adept will find that the veil will inevitably have thinned. What does this mean, the veil having thinned? Well, for one thing, we can say that the indigo ray energy center will have been activated and this will permit the influx of a kind of energy that wells up from within a very deep space, if we may use that metaphor. It is a space that is within.&nbsp;

This energy that wells up from within can be understood as a portion of the native endowment of the mind/body/spirit complex. And we would tell you that it is a very refined energy; so refined in fact that for the most part it goes completely unnoticed.&nbsp;

When, however, the indigo ray has released its blockage this energy begins to well up and to permeate the whole system of the aspiring adept. And in the process it will have an effect that can be disorienting in the extreme.&nbsp;

The catalyst with which the aspirant must now deal will not necessarily look any different from the standpoint of an outside observer, for the events of the day will be as they will be. But the orientation of the core power of reception on the part of the aspirant will have changed subtly at first, and more dramatically as time goes on. So that the events which transpire shall come to be seen in a light more and more removed from that which is familiar.&nbsp;

Now this moment has sometimes been called by your peoples the moment of faith, which does have a transforming effect upon all that it touches. But we would tell you equally that, within this moment that may be called faith, there is also a great propensity towards distancing of the self from all that is familiar, from all that has been taken as a support or a grounding for the sense of self that has been cultivated over long years of experience.&nbsp;

The filtering is therefore removed, at first perhaps ever so slightly, but more and more pronouncedly as time goes on. With the feeling of being torn away from the familiar supports that have long been expected, the adept will perforce take on a new attitude towards the catalyst that comes toward this aspiring spirit.&nbsp;

The aspiring adept will very often be thrown off its balance as a result of not necessarily a series of catalytic events different in kind from what has been experienced previously, but seen differently from within. And therefore there comes to be a new dimension, shall we say, of catalyst, a dimension that is more internal in its origin and for which there is very little preparation.&nbsp;

The accompanying sense of self that the adept will experience is almost completely unrecognizable to the adept. And in consequence, the catalytic events can seem sudden, unexpected, of such a nature that they interrupt all hope of internal balance.&nbsp;

There is now not the familiar set of commitments or identifications with others that have previously served as a portion of the veiled way in which your human interactions have occurred. Other selves therefore can be seen in a manner that is stripped of the protective membrane that has so long been in place. And this begins to afford a different set of parameters governing the interaction with other selves. And as the adept moves into the archetypal framework of the Experience of Spirit, the requirement for interpreting these new features of interaction with other selves comes to the fore.&nbsp;

We have described the Experience of the Spirit as that which is only dimly lit, as if by moonlight, leaving, therefore, many shadows and uncertainties concerning what is perceived or how that which is perceived shall be taken in.&nbsp;

It may come about that the other self shall be seen as exposed in its vulnerabilities, shall be seen as possessed of energies or capabilities or powers which could be marshaled as resources for the further empowerment of the adept. The other self being more exposed in areas in which the other self is very likely not itself aware means that a very subtle form of influence may be exerted resulting in a power to control, a power to control that may or may not be seen for what it is by the adept now empowered to exercise it.&nbsp;

And thus that which is of the nature of control may be seen by an adept that thinks itself oriented towards service to others as a portion of that very orientation. Thus is the polarity of the fledgling adept at risk. And we speak now of energies that cut so deep that we will tell you that, yea, this is a significant risk for, as we have suggested previously, missteps in this arena are very, very easy.&nbsp;

Now another possibility that the aspiring adept may encounter in dealing with other selves is that the other self exposed to the slowly clarifying visual capacity of the adept shall not be seen in its vulnerabilities so much as its repulsiveness. The adept can become repulsed by other selves, especially if through some pattern of self-programming, whether in this incarnation or previous to it, a kind of lock has been placed upon the possibility of manipulation we have just discussed, a kind of safety mechanism, one might call it.&nbsp;

So one sees the other self with the membrane of illusion, the beauteous surface stripped away, and what now appears is not at all pretty to the eye. And this can happen over and over again so that the aspiring adept grows more and more isolated, turns more and more inward, and wants less and less to do with other selves. For they represent nothing but ugliness, confusion, distortion, need, and imposition.&nbsp;

How shall the Experience of Spirit be now processed, set in the pattern of beingness so that the adept may yet go forth in the resolve that withal, and despite all, service to others shall prevail? Oh, my friends, these are questions that cut deep. For so much of that which you call your desire has been trained upon a kind of mutuality and sharing, the circumstances of which are conditioned by a society, the values of which have now been stripped away, so that no conventions still apply, so that no mannered or pre-structured pathways towards human relationships remain available.&nbsp;

And one must find within the resources to love, without stint, that which is seen as unlovable. And, yea, as one goes further down these pathways into the Experience of Spirit, one will discover that all this new energy which is upon one, which is within one, which is about one, has after all arisen from within.&nbsp; So that the very light in which the other is now seen—vulnerable, ugly, distorted—is a light which, in fact, reflects the inward condition of the self–vulnerable, ugly, distorted.

And now the Experience turned inward must reckon with distortions that must be owned as a portion of the being of the self. And these distortions must be brought forward, must be examined, must be allowed to be penetrated by the impossible light of hope. For there is no formula one may follow to discover that these distortions may yet be redeemed. They, for all the world, will seem unredeemable. And the more clear the perception of the distortions, the more unredeemable they must inevitably seem. And therefore we say that the light of hope here, as it comes to the adept, comes through the atmosphere of impossibility. And yet it is a palpable truth that it is available. Release of the distortion can happen though seemingly through no agency the adept, in fact, possesses.&nbsp;

And here Catalyst has merged with Experience as the living embodiment of faith. It is a faith in which the greatest joy may be found hand in hand with the deepest sorrow, as if in truth they were but one thing.&nbsp;

We are those of Q’uo, and we thank those here gathered for the opportunity to speak in difficult circumstances upon a topic that is, at least, as difficult. We thank you for your patience and your dedication, my friends. At this time, we take our leave of this instrument and this group. Adonai, my friends. Adonai. ☥
