title: Laitos on the Discerning Instrument
group_question: We have a circle of seeking in which we are joined together as one, inviting beings of a higher density to join with us in our seeking, and we are desirous of knowing, as we proceed in this enterprise of opening ourselves up to what these beings of a higher density might have to offer, how we can learn to discern and discriminate that which is coming from the beings that we have invited to our circle of seeking and what is coming from us.
introduction: The fourth density social memory complex of Laitos visits the Other Selves Working Group’s first gathering in Estes Park, Colorado to discuss the practice of channeling with two student instruments. They counsel those gathered to look to their own inner spiritual connection to a deeper reality as a help when verifying the connection to higher density contacts. The entire process of channeling prompts deeper questioning within the seeker regarding the basis of one’s own narrow identity, and working with this tentative nature of the self will help the instrument tease out which elements of contact truly arise from without those boundaries, however arbitrary. Laitos concludes by encouraging new instruments to not overly stress the provenance of the message received; whether it arises from the self as narrowly construed or from other selves, the tuning of the channeling group's calling has the most determinative effect on the appropriateness of the information.
