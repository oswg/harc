title: Q'uo on the Matrix and Potentiator of the Body and Healing
group_question: The question today is having to do with the archetypical mind, the body archetype specifically. And we will begin with the matrix of the body and the potentiator of the body within the context of healing.
introduction: Q'uo describes healing as a dynamic interplay between the body's signals of imbalance and the wisdom to make effective choices for restoration. The matrix of the body, representing balance, and the potentiator of the body, associated with wisdom, guide this process. Healing involves observing and responding to these signals with consistent attention, aligning with the body's natural rhythms to maintain wellness.

_(Linus channeling)_

**We are those of Q’uo** , and we greet you in the love and the light of the One Infinite Creator. We are grateful to be present with you and invited by way of challenge to your circle at this time to speak about the query regarding the matrix of the body and the potentiator of the body with respect to healing. 

Before we begin our remarks, we would like to provide our customary reminder that we are fellow seekers and that it is important for each to filter our words through your own powers of discernment to leave behind what is not useful to you at this point in your seeking. In doing this, we feel free to share our own perspective and freedom of expression, being just one of many possible perspectives which you may consider. 

Returning now to the question at hand regarding healing with respect to the archetypes of the body which describe particular relationships and structures within the archetypal mind and healing with respect to these. We find that the topic of healing, its focus in examination and reflection upon these archetypes, is a very fruitful one for each is given a body to serve as a companion, friend, and teacher during the incarnation. But healing presupposes illness, imbalance, disease, unwellness, and these conditions invariably come to touch each one during the incarnative experience. And so healing is the resolution, the bringing into balance, the restoration of wellness, of even functioning. 

Let us examine the matrix of the body. The image that you are familiar with, that has been used as a teaching aid to work with this archetype of the body, namely the matrix of the body, is that of a woman seated holding scales. These scales are a symbol of balance. And so one might consider when things go awry, or when illness is present, that perhaps the state is not so balanced; things seem to not work or function as one may think they should. 

It has been said that the matrix of the body is that which is always active. And so we invite you, my friends, to consider that all around you is a reflection of an inner balance. Each is provided with the physical vehicle which you call the body, and this companion very dutifully reflects to you and indicates to you objects for your reflection and imbalances, but also outwardly in the outer world, for the body is that part of the illusion which presents apparent separateness, a boundary. And outwardly, things can seem very imbalanced. 

So now having explored balance/imbalance, what is to be done? How does one work within balance toward restoring balance or discovering balance? And in this we turn to the potentiator of the body, which in your archetypal image is represented by the sage and also said to be wisdom. In relationship to that which is always active and present, be it even functioning or the lack thereof, one is provided with choices to be made with what one perceives. The body provides signals, impulses, instincts, impressions, and one must decide how to respond. And this principle or strategy of effective choice-making with respect to these is what is encapsulated within the archetype of the potentiator of the body. 

Those activities of the body and proclivities of the body which are always active may be observed to be in flux, in a dynamic with the choices and strategy that is employed. It is in careful observation and diligence and attention that one may find the golden path to balance and even functioning such that what is provided may be used effectively. 

And so we return to the specific inquiry with regard to healing and these two archetypes. When we consider an illness or state of unwellness, we may then reflect upon what is imbalanced and what may need to be disciplined or left aside or exercised or given love and attention in consistency. For it is not the case that balance is static in this case, for the state is in dynamic tension and flux, and it is through careful repetition and consistency that the useful modes become stable. 

Healing then requires opening to those processes and cycles which repeat in one's life over the course of the day, the week, the month, and year after year. One must be open to difficult truths and be willing to accept the fact of proclivities and activities that are necessary and present. And so, in this aspect of healing, one may begin to learn to work with the grain as opposed to against the grain of what is given. 

We believe that what we have shared in our exploration and consideration of the question has been exhausted for the moment, and we thank you for this question and for the opportunity to be present with you in this discussion. 

And so now we ask to take our leave. We are those of Q’uo. Adonai, my friends. ☥
