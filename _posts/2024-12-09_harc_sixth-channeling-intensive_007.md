title: Laitos on the Shadow Self
event: ci6
session: '007'
introduction: In this transmission, Laitos addresses the concept of the shadow self, a byproduct of third density separation from unity, which grows from repressed shame and emotions. The shadow, often ignored or hidden, can unexpectedly resurface, causing confusion. Understanding and accepting the shadow involves recognizing and forgiving the aspects of the self that are projected onto others. Through acceptance and loving awareness, one can integrate the shadow, leading to self-healing, compassion, and a sense of wholeness. This process diminishes judgment and fosters a more integrated self, essential for the spiritual journey towards unity with the One Infinite Creator.

**We are Laitos** , and we are with this instrument. We come to blend our energies with you and share our thoughts with you on the subject of shadow.&nbsp;We encourage each of you to use discernment to consider our thoughts, and if there are any that do not resonate with you, we ask that you leave them aside. We are but travelers on the journey, just as you are, and may our words only serve to inspire but never to be considered authority.&nbsp;

This subject, "shadow," is a condition unique to your third density experience such that you are so separated from your true nature of unity with others and with the Creator.&nbsp;We give this instrument the image of a child newly born into this world with only its parents and surroundings to consider its place in the world. There are so many concepts and challenges that will face the young entity. The innocence will not last long as desires and limitations come into sharp focus as the entity grows.&nbsp;

As the entity first tastes the bitter brew that is shame, the shadow is fed; the shadow is perceived. It may not be conscious, but as thoughts, feelings, and emotions that are not wanted come to the surface, the shadow grows. As the entity learns to navigate, often the shadow is pushed aside, unacknowledged and shut out. The shadow grows.&nbsp;

As the entity gets older, things once pushed away into a corner, shut away in a closet, bubble to the surface: They surprise the entity; they shock the entity. Where is this coming from? I don't recognize this feeling. It may be perceived that this comes from elsewhere outside the entity itself.

The entity seeks relief through distraction, through alcohol, yet the shadow only grows. It is now so distorted, it bears little resemblance to its origin when the entity was young. Yet it is always there.&nbsp;How do we reckon with this shadow?&nbsp;

At this point, we will leave this instrument and pass our contact to the one known as Linus.&nbsp;

What is the nature of shadow? Light is cast and obscured, and it casts through this interaction of light and object a scattering of light into something that is between light and darkness, yet neither. To come to terms with the shadow, it can be useful to contemplate and consider its nature and how it is maintained throughout one's life, how it forms.

Difficult choices present themselves to oneself throughout the course of life; decisions that seem to have no easy answer or response. Sometimes these choices are not properly understood, nor can they be, for when one is young, many choices that are made can have a long arc of shadow in one's life. And so one can develop forgetfulness of these choices that were made. It would seem that the shadow and forgetfulness bear a close relationship, and that confusion can be carried long in the formation of these types of choices.&nbsp;

And so, shadow would appear to be how one relates to self. Things that are not able to be accepted about the self then recede into shadow and then appear to present themselves outwardly through the mirror of other selves.&nbsp;To see what is difficult to accept about another self can be fruitful for shining light on what is in oneself that cannot be accepted, and the energy and act of forgiveness is that which allows the shadow to transform into a beloved part of the self.&nbsp;

We are Laitos, and at this time we would transfer the contact to the one known as Baris.&nbsp; We are Laitos.&nbsp;

We feel gratitude for bringing this most interesting topic in the latter days of your third density. As the light increases in its intensity, you are starting to be more aware of the shadow that the light casts.&nbsp;

This shadow is an aspect of yourself. It is an aspect of yourself that you've chosen to look away, that you've chosen not to associate with. And as you go about your days, as life brings opportunities for you to view what's in the shadow in others, the immediate response tends to be of one of rejection, of judgment. This desire not to accept, not to associate with, manifests itself in further separation between you and the other that demonstrates that which is also part of you.&nbsp;And of course, my friends, how can you work with the shadow unless you first start with acceptance?

As you become aware of these energies, of these aspects that are yours gently, gently noticing and slowly accepting that these are also part of yourselves is the only way you can then bring these parts of yourselves into light. Only by acceptance you can start to work on them.&nbsp;And what is it to work on them? When you accept, you just become aware. Your awareness brings the light, and in that light, shadow can't be.

As you bring your loving awareness onto yourself, as you collect yourself as your whole self, you can start to heal. You can start to relate to yourself with more compassion. You can start to feel whole, and then that wholeness starts to heal, and that healing energy can start emanating out of you and touching others as well.&nbsp;The judgment slowly reduces as you slowly stop judging yourself and thereby judging others. From the place of wholeness, from self-acceptance, from a deeper relationship with yourself, a new aspect is born.&nbsp;

We feel we've started to touch the surface of this very interesting concept: the shadow self as an integral part of oneself to be first acknowledged, then accepted, then with loving awareness skillfully worked with to bring into light. That is the journey.&nbsp;

With that, we leave you in the ineffable love and the light of the One Infinite Creator. Thank you, my friends. Adonai. ☥
