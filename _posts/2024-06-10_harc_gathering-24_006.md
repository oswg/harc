title: Q'uo on Setting Intentions
group_question: Today we would like to ask for Q'uo to speak on the mechanics of setting intentions.
introduction: In this final session from the Working Group’s 2024 gathering, those of Q’uo address concerns around the setting of intention. They begin by counseling the seeker to tidy their mind and heart, recognizing that one cannot eliminate all impediments to transformation. On the service-to-others path we set our best intentions by seeking their alignment with the Creator’s will. By using a lighter touch in effecting our own will, we make space for our intentions to keep pace with phenomenal opportunities and deepen with reflection. Follow up questions are offered with respect to lessening Earth’s suffering and intentionally programming dreams.
