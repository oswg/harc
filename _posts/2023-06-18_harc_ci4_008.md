title: Q'uo on Cynicism
group_question: The question for this session is how does one best relate to the cynicism within oneself?
introduction: Those of Q'uo address the dynamic of cynicism or doubt as a normal aspect of life in third density given how little we truly know and can see about the nature of our illusion. Working with this cynicism is part and parcel of working with its opposite, faith, and in this balancing we learn to ascertain the true nature of reality through direct experience. Q'uo also discusses the role cynicism plays in how we relate to other selves as a projection of our inner integration.
