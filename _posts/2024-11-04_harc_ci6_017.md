title: Quo on the Journey of Self Discovery
introduction: Through a training instrument, those of the Q'uo principle discuss self-discovery as a process of remembering, guided by higher selves and signposts encountered along life's journey. Dreams are highlighted as a significant, yet often overlooked, connection to the unconscious, offering lessons that require honesty and effort to interpret. Q'uo cautions against the allure of adopting external identities in a world full of distractions and instead advocates for meditation and introspection as essential practices for genuine self-discovery.
