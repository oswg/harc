So the concept today is sorrow and the spiritual path. I am Laitos and we are with this instrument. We greet you in the love and light of the One Infinite Creator. We are pleased to have this opportunity to speak to those assembled on the subject of sorrow and the spiritual path. Please consider our words only as much as they are useful and disregard any of our words. Words which you do not find useful at this time. For we humbly offer our perspective on this voluminous topic. Sorrow is often referred to as an emotion and it is. But in a pure form, it is also an opening of the Green Ray Center. And indeed, such an opening often springboards into the Blue and Indigo Ray and beyond for those entities who have sufficiently crystallized those centers as to allow the upward movement of such energy. Sorrow is a natural part of existence in third density and also in densities beyond. Sorrow is a natural part of existence in third density and also in densities beyond. Like many emotions that are associated with certain energetic configurations, it is useful to approach one's sorrow from the perspective of one's chosen service. A service to others entity accepts the sorrow and allows it to flow freely when experienced. However, it is understandable that in your tumultuous third density experience, it can sometimes feel overwhelming to allow intense sorrow to be felt freely and openly and accepted. And sometimes may take a longer portion of what you call time to fully allow oneself to feel and express such sorrow. As has been said, service to others involves acceptance and as a contrast, service to self seeks control, including control of things that they perceive to be within their separate self. And that includes the feeling, expression, and flow of sorrow, only allowing it if it serves such a service to self entities purposes at that time. It should also be mentioned that great sorrow is powerful enough that it can result for the service to others entity a spontaneous opening of the gateway to intelligent infinity. And indeed, some so-called miracles have occurred upon the sincere breath of one humbly, we correct this instrument, of one humbly surrendering themselves to their sorrow and whispering a prayer to the one infinite creator from a place of acceptance and love. This is a quite interesting topic of which there are many more aspects to explore regarding the nature of sorrow and indeed the experience of sorrow. And so now we leave this instrument and transfer this contact to the one known as Stephanie. I am Latos. Thank you. We are Latos. And we are with this instrument. To this instrument.
