title: Oorkas on the Light Touch
group_question: How do we serve with the proper finesse, where we don't seek to dictate outcomes but we acknowledge our desire for results? How do we understand our individual link in the great chain of service, where we can trust in the goodness of outcomes, both desired and disappointing?
introduction: Oorkas is a new contact for Richmond Meditation Circle, clearly related to the "Orcas" that L/L Research channelled some forty years ago[1](#footnote-1). This newly fourth density social memory complex relates very touchingly to our dilemmas of third density veiled service, suggesting that we develop a flexibility and humor towards a very discombobulating illusion. The manner in which Oorkas incorporates the interruptions encountered during this session are a fitting example of this temperament they connect to Ra's concept of the light touch. Those of Oorkas assure us that the suffering and tragedies of Earth are not for naught, and that the very response those seemingly unfortunate events elicit in us demonstrate the breadth of our potential beyond this density.
