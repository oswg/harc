title: Hatonn on Blending Energies
group_question: We are going to take a potluck in the tradition of Carla. So we are interested in any remarks the Confederation might wish to make this evening to kick off our 2025 Richmond Meditation Circle Invitational.
introduction: In this short session inaugurating the Richmond Meditation Circle's 2025 Invitational, Hatonn pays a long overdue visit to discuss how the mysteries of oneness might be recognized in the illusion. Starting from the energetic nature of contact between the circle and their complex, they place before the seeker the choice of how they might perceive and make sense of outer events. This heuristic is extended to material objects and the operation of cause and effect, showing how the blending of energies enabling communication between the circle and Hatonn can be found analogously in all aspects of the illusion. The ubiquitous presence of this blending provides a hint about the unity behind the appearance of separation.

_(Jeremy channeling)_

**I am Hatonn**. I am with this instrument and bid you all good evening. It is our custom to come when we are called, and we feel the call this evening. My brothers and sisters, conditions are ripe, for you have prepared yourselves for not just one contact with members of our circle, our Confederation, but several opportunities lie before us. And in the spirit of bringing it back to basics, shall we say, we wish to visit again in all good humor and with a tender welcome to those who have not participated before. This instrument has long wondered why we have not visited, but we know he is certain in his trust of his faculties of tuning. And we are grateful to have the window which has been opened for us so that we may commune with your circle. And once again, synchronously share the love, light, power, and grace of he, of she, of the one who is our Creator, your Creator, the Creator of all.&nbsp;

We will not detain your circle long, my brothers and sisters, for it is somewhat later than normal. And we have but a limited message to offer, unprompted by the discrete question normally offered a contact such as us. But first, let us set the house in order by offering our standard concern plainly to your circle, so that you may place our words in the proper context with no confusion.&nbsp;

It is typical that contacts from our planet are treated with a certain regard by those who have an interest in the greater philosophy that we have had a small part in conferring to your peoples. We have no qualms about being held in a certain regard, for we reciprocate this respect. It is, however, crucial that you balance what we say with your own discernment, that you not ascribe authority to us. This is a topic this instrument has recently belabored with one of our students, and it bears reiterating. Should we speak and your ears close to the message, you must honor your ears, my brothers and sisters. You must honor your hearts and your searching minds, for they are closer to the divinity within you than our complex can claim.&nbsp;

So please disregard any of our words that catch you in a pickle, or simply do not seem quite right. For, as this instrument has shared, we are a little bit off the beaten track this evening. You do best by letting the message be what it is, offering your love, your light, your power to the circle's thought form in and of itself. And, being content to take the measure of the message at some future point, this is the advantage of the recording devices you use, that you can focus on the moment and let the words be what they will, without having to commit your heart to their truth or falsity. Thank you, thank you, thank you for being very diligent in sifting through the chaff that words must inevitably constitute so that the wheat may be savored, and savored not simply as our message, but verily, my friends, as your own. For you blend your energies with ours, and this is well, this is the pattern of contact that we have participated in with those of your kind for many, many years.&nbsp;

Now, you have heard us say that we blend energies with you, and you with us, and that this mixture is at the root of the very message you hear. What might this mean to you? We encourage you to think on this. Contact with non-corporeal intelligence is not very different, you see, from contact with those you sit next to or those who hustle and bustle about your place of working.&nbsp;

This blending is part of the root of phenomena as you perceive them in this band of vibration. Because it is a blending, it begins to become uncertain in the extreme, my brothers and sisters, who is responsible for the message. For we draw upon your love and your calling as much as our own. We, too, call: we call for opportunities to serve; we call for guidance from those aspects of the Creator who blend with us. And in this blending, we do not pick and choose whose cause yields whose effect, you see. It is as one piece when the blending has occurred. It is a kind of pool of potential created from the convergence of hearts and minds. In other words, my brothers and sisters, it is a small foray into the reunification that draws all towards the conclusion of the octave. By this, we mean to indicate that operating at this more refined level, where discrete bodies lose their boundaries in each other, where you start to look for the motion of manifestation rather than that aspect of manifestation which grounds itself and stays static for your easy ascertainment. This leads to a kind of fuzzing of boundaries, and in this condition, how would one even speak of cause and effect? For it is all of one piece.

Now, this blending of energies is truly occurring constantly with or without your direct participation. It is simply a matter of keying into it, of looking—instead of where the objects are distinct—of looking in the spaces between the objects and seeing how they mutually reinforce one another. When change occurs, when a shift is noted, this is seen as some sort of result: a result that has a situating cause. This is a valid way of interpreting the patterns of the illusion such that meaning, narrative, order can be manufactured out of the plenum. But it is not, my friends, the only way to go about perceiving. Another way you may take stock of what the illusion has ready to disclose to you is to dilate the focus, and to see the blending _instead_ of those items that stand apart from the swirl of energies.&nbsp;

These conditions are a choice of perception, you see, not something innate in the phenomenon itself. So you see, cause and effect can be perceived, can be interpreted, instead of one object exerting force on another, as one consolidated object too big to perceive as a unity, too dispersed to see its motion as a contiguous phenomenon.&nbsp;

These are all fancy ways of saying cause and effect is in the eye of the beholder. This has implications for your physics, for if objects are merely, at the end of the day, fields, then it is but an ontological gamble when one tells the story of “what happened.“ But you always have the option of seeing the unity between things and to see what seems to be the cause and what seems to be the effect as simply two sides of a shape moving synchronously through space. The change is some sort of indication of the temporal element involved. And this time passing is largely orchestrated as a function of consciousness.

You, in this circle, have contrived your consciousness to a point of focus: to find your center, and through that center, to place your finger on the center of the working, the point around which your fellow seekers orbit.&nbsp;Now, we wish to show that this account of the physical appearance of things has an analog, a more purified source in the consciousness you bring to bear. Just as it is impossible to tell whether you thinking of your friend caused them to respond, or their response was picked up beforehand by you, or both sides of the perception are connected inherently and occur with simultaneity, so too must you wonder: whose authorship is responsible for this message? Does it come from you? Does it come from brothers and sisters far away? Or is it possible, my friends, that if we are one in truth, that this is a distinction without a difference?&nbsp;

We ask you to contemplate this earnestly—not because there is a correct answer here, but because this is an example of the turning of the cube metaphor we have employed in the past. For these are all ontological gambles; these are all models that are used to situate the illusion creatively. This is what it means, my brothers and sisters, to be self-aware: that you have a choice of how to perceive the panoply of distortions around you. You have a choice of how you regard mystery as it precipitates into your life. There is even the option of not making a clean and clear judgment call at all, but to simply let what filters into your awareness be as it is.&nbsp;

We would ask that you contemplate these matters as you proceed into your weekend working. For we want you to appreciate this contact as not one fixed thing. You go about your rituals and your invocations and tunings and intention setting for a purpose. What contact has the potential to do, my friends, is to mirror back a deeper element of this purpose so that you may see something new in your own mind/body/spirit complex as well as the complex you create together. For at the end of the day, if we are truly all one, then our use of the illusion in appreciation of catalyst, in celebration of love shared, is but a small recapitulation of the grand project of our Creator. And you may endeavor to understand and accept more and more fully this oneness by reaching into your patrimony as the Creator.&nbsp;

This is our message this evening. We are those of Hatonn. We thank your circle for letting this message, so difficult for this instrument to bridge, come through so that he may have an experience that is new, and you may share in this newness and cast your eyes upon the world freshly as small probes of the Creator into its own nature.&nbsp;

May we address a question or two from your circle today?&nbsp;

**Dave** : Hatonn, I don't have a question, but I would like to share my gratitude and your connection and your message that you shared with us today.&nbsp;

**Hatonn** : We thank you, my brother. We are not unaware of the calling from your heart. We only hope that we find that overlap in our callings such that we may praise our Creator together that much more earnestly, that much more purely, that much more effortlessly and joyously.&nbsp;

Seeing as there are no queries we may address, we will leave the matter there, allowing this instrument and your circle to conserve energy for tomorrow's workings. And leaving you, our brothers and sisters, so dear to us, in the love and light of our radiant One Infinite Creator, we will now take our leave of this circle.&nbsp;

We are those of Hatonn. Adonai vasu, my brothers and sisters. Adonai vasu boragus. ☥
